Voice concern to the group and have a solid gameplan of what needs to be accomplished and a clear agreement of division of labor. This will prevent this possibility from accuring.

**How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**
