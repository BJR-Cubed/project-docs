# Requirements 

## Vision

A media platform hosted by Heroku where users can communicate via CLI in the browser. Users can create an account and post, edit, and delete "Creets" on a public live timeline.

We will add an edit function allowing users to edit "creets" so they can correct "creets" they did not think about before "creeting". It is a lightweight version of Twitter and is a great way to connect with others.

People should care about this application becasue it gives users an alternative to a big social media platform and also allows users more options when it comes to editing their own messages.
